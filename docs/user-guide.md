# User Guide â€” Candidate & Regular User

This user guide covers the basic flows for non-admin users (candidates and regular users) interacting with the Techademy Interview system.

## Quick start for candidates

1. Receive invite email with a unique link.
2. Click the link to open the interview portal.
3. Follow on-screen instructions (read the context prompt, microphone/permissions if audio mode).
4. Complete the attempt(s) within the suggested time.
5. After submission, wait for the report to be generated by the system.

## Candidates interface tips

- If the interview is audio-based, grant microphone permissions and test your recording before starting.
- Keep responses concise and on-topic; long monologues may reduce clarity in automated scoring.
- If you have multiple attempts allowed, ensure you are aware of attempt limits and whether you should use multiple tries.

## How reports are shown to users

- After evaluation, reports may be available to admins and, depending on settings, to the candidate.
- Reports show parameter-level scores, an overall percentage, and a summary where available.
- CEFR labels (A1..C2) may be shown if the interview was configured with CEFR evaluation.

## Common user questions

- Q: How long before results are ready?
  - A: Generation time varies (a few seconds to a couple of minutes) depending on transcript processing and model latency.

- Q: Can I re-attempt the interview?
  - A: Only if the admin has allowed multiple attempts for your candidate or the interview's default maxAttempts is greater than 1.

- Q: Can I see my proctor photo?
  - A: Proctor photos are shown in admin reports for verification. Depending on your platform policies, you may or may not see them in candidate view.

## Troubleshooting (candidate side)

- Microphone not working: Ensure browser permissions are granted and no other app is blocking access.
- Upload failed: Check file size and type restrictions for resume uploads.
- No report shown: It may be pending; contact the recruiter or admin for details.

If you want these guides added inside the application help panel (so clicking `?` opens the admin/user guide), I can add the content and a small table-of-contents link at the top of the Help panel. Also happy to export these as PDF versions if you want shareable documents.
